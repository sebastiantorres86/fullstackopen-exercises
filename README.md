The exercises are submitted via GitHub, and by marking the exercises as done in the submission system.

I submit all of the exercises into the same repository,.

The way to name the directories in my submission repository is as follows:

```
part0
part1
  ├─ courseinfo
	├─ unicafe
	├─ anecdotes
part2
  ├─ phonebook
  ├─ countries
```

So, each part has its own directory, which contains a directory for each exercise set (like the unicafe exercises in part 1).

The exercises are submitted one part at a time.
